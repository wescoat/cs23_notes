The present document is a collection of study notes on \emph{Essentials of Discrete Mathematics}, 3rd ed., by David J.\ Hunter.
These notes freely quote from the book without proper citation.
Consequently, this document does not represent my original work, and it is not intended for any sort of publication or wide distribution.
If anyone plucks any part out of this document for inclusion in another work, there is a high probability that she will find herself plagiarizing Hunter's original text.
